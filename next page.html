                <p class="mt-15">There will be an emergency response meeting in Downing Street on Monday after more than 150 people were arrested following violent disorder in UK towns and cities over the weekend.</p>
                <p class="mt-15">It comes after Sir Keir Starmer condemned an attack on a hotel housing asylum seekers in Rotherham and promised those involved in unrest would face "the full force of the law".</p>
                <p class="mt-15">Police responded to violent scenes in Tamworth, Middlesbrough, Bolton, Hull and Weymouth, among other parts of the UK</p>
                <p class="mt-15">The prime minister vowed to do "whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice" as he addressed the nation on Sunday.</p>
                <p class="mt-15">Cobra meetings, or Cobr meetings as they are often also called, are named after Cabinet Office Briefing Room A on Whitehall.</p>
                <p class="mt-15">It is an emergency response committee, a get together of ministers, civil servants, the police, intelligence officers and others appropriate to whatever they are looking into.</p>
                <p class="mt-15">Monday's meeting of the emergency committee will be intended to provide the government with an update on the violence over the weekend and the response in the coming days. It will involve relevant ministers and police representatives.</p>
                <p class="mt-15">Sources have suggested this should be seen in the context of meetings that have already taken place, such as one between the prime minister and police chiefs last Thursday, and a meeting of senior ministers on Saturday.</p>
